# Alternatives to UGREEN NASync OS (UGOS)

UGOS v1.0 has several shortcomings given its their first version. You may or may not be concerned about the maturity of the NAS operating system if all you want is to store photos on a RAID array with some web interface. However, some users have a bare minimum list of expectations of a NAS. Myself included.

UGOS v1.0 was released without the ability to take snapshots or protect your data against ransomware. This is important for me, it may not be for you. This page shares some resources and options that I may have an opinion on.

I've been a proxmox users for over a decade, its built on the most reliable open source linux distribution Debian. The OS itself is not a NAS and it is meant to be a virtual machine hypervisor node. Nothing stops you from extending this and converting your hypervisor into a NAS combo which is what I have chosen to do.

July 2024: Tested ZimaOS which basically extends the CasaOS file manager to also do virtual machines and RAID. There are a lot of bugs in this beta v1.2.1.
